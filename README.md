# pyRandr Brightness Adjuster
Allows brightness changing effect without actual controlling of the backlight.
If your backlight adjustment is not working with ubuntu, you can try this as a 
temporary solution.

Inspired by those opensource Linux users who can't yet make their hardware backlight
adjustment funciton yet. Doesn't saves energy but allows your eyes to get more comfort.

Inspired by some http://thcc.name (open hardware catalogue) users.

Forked from: https://gist.github.com/ravikiranj/6034290

Added multi-monitor support.
